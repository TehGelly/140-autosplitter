# 140 Auto Splitter

How to get started:

1. Click "Clone or download", then "Download ZIP"
2. Save it to `C:\dev`
3. Extract it so that you have a folder called `140-autosplitter` in `C:\dev`
4. Open livesplit
5. Open the splits file and layout file in `C:\dev\140-autosplitter`
6. Start 140
7. Have fun!

Just to clarify - after the extraction you should have these files:
```
C:\dev\140-autosplitter\140.asl
C:\dev\140-autosplitter\140.lsl
C:\dev\140-autosplitter\140.lss
C:\dev\140-autosplitter\README.md
```

Note that if you want to put the files somewhere else you need to edit the layout so that it knows where to look for the `140.asl` file (the auto splitter file).

Note that you could also get the files by downloading them individually or by cloning this repository :)
